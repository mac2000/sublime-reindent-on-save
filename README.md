===============================

![screenshot](https://github.com/mac2000/sublime-reindent-on-save/raw/master/screenshot.gif)

This is simple plugin to call *reindent* each time you save your file.

What you should be aware is that sublime's *reindent* is not perfect.

You can specify file types which you want to be reindented on save:

    "reindent_on_save": ["css", "SCSS", "html", "Js"]


Installation
------------

The recommended installation method is via Package Control. Learn more here: https://sublime.wbond.net/.
